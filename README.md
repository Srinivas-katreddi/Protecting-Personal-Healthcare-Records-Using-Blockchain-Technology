# PROTECTING PERSONAL HEALTHCARE RECORDS USING BOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY


 # ABSTRACT 

> Health and medicine are essential to human well-being, making the protection of personal healthcare records a critical concern.
> Traditional Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems rely on centralized architectures, which pose security risks such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and single points of failure.
> Blockchain technology provides a decentralized solution to enhance the security, privacy, and integrity of healthcare records.
> Unlike traditional systems, blockchain eliminates reliance on a single authority, reducing vulnerabilities associated with central servers.
> This research explores blockchain-based methods for securing personal healthcare records, focusing on access control, data sharing, and privacy preservation.


# INTRODUCTION

> Managing and protecting Personal Healthcare Records (PHRs) is increasingly challenging due to unauthorized access, data fragmentation, and privacy risks.
> This project explores the application of blockchain technology to solve these challenges, ensuring enhanced security, privacy, and accessibility.
> By leveraging blockchain’s decentralized, transparent, and immutable features, the system empowers patients to control their own healthcare data.
> The approach fosters trust between patients and healthcare providers, creating a more reliable healthcare system.


# EXISTING SYSTEM

> The existing system primarily relies on centralized databases for healthcare data storage.
> Some techniques like CNN, Xception, and YOLO are used for disease detection, but there are challenges related to data privacy, fragmentation, and lack of a comprehensive solution.
# LIMITATIONS
1.  Privacy risks associated with data sharing. 
2.  Fragmentation of patient data.
3.  Limited patient control over healthcare records.


# PROPOSED SYSTEM

The proposed system uses blockchain technology to secure and protect Personal Healthcare Records (PHRs). By decentralizing data storage, it prevents unauthorized access and reduces the risk of  data  breaches.  Blockchain’s  immutability  ensures  data integrity, while giving patients full control over their healthcare data.
# ADVANTAGES
1. Secure and Private 
2. Enhanced Security
3. Patient Control 
4. Data Recovery


# ALGORITHMS

1. SECURE HASH ALGORITHM  (SHA)
>  	It is used for securing passwords, ensuring data integrity, creating digital signatures, generating secure tokens, and verifying file integrity.
2. ADVANCED ENCRYPTION STANDARD (AES)
>  	It is used encrypting sensitive data, securing communications, protecting database records, ensuring safe file storage, and enabling secure transactions.
3. CRYPTOGRAPHICALLY SECURE PSEUDORANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR
>  	A cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) is a random number generator that's designed to be unpredictable and resistant to attacks. CSPRNGs 	are used in many cryptographic protocols



# CONCLUSION
> The blockchain-based system improves the security, privacy, and accessibility of Personal Healthcare Records (PHRs).
> It prevents unauthorized access and cyberattacks by decentralizing data storage. Patients have full control over their data, ensuring secure and transparent sharing.
> This project explores the application of blockchain technology to solve these challenges, ensuring enhanced security, privacy, and accessibility.
> By leveraging blockchain’s decentralized, transparent, and immutable features, the system empowers patients to control their own healthcare data.
