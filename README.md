1.INTRODUCTION
1.1 Overview of the application:

The modern healthcare ecosystem is increasingly reliant on digital technologies to manage and store patient data. As medical records move from paper-based systems to electronic platforms, ensuring the security and privacy of sensitive health information has become a paramount concern. Traditional Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems, which are typically built on centralized architectures, face significant challenges. These systems are vulnerable to unauthorized access, data breaches, and systemic failures due to their reliance on a single controlling authority. 
Blockchain technology emerges as a promising solution to address these issues. By leveraging a decentralized framework, blockchain can distribute the storage of records across multiple nodes, thereby reducing the risk of a single point of failure. The technology’s inherent features—such as encryption, consensus mechanisms, and immutable ledgers—provide robust security measures that ensure data integrity and protect patient privacy.
 This documentation explores the application of blockchain in the context of personal healthcare records. The study examines various blockchain-based methods for securing sensitive medical data, including:
 • Access Control: Implementing decentralized authorization protocols that ensure only authorized individuals can access patient information. 
• Data Sharing: Facilitating secure and efficient sharing of healthcare data across different stakeholders without compromising privacy. 
• Privacy Preservation: Employing cryptographic techniques and smart contracts to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of personal health records. 
By reviewing relevant literature and blockchain frameworks from 2018 to 2022, this work aims to identify both the opportunities and challenges in deploying blockchain solutions in healthcare environments. The documentation is structured to provide a comprehensive analysis, starting with an overview of current challenges in traditional EHR systems, followed by an in-depth examination of blockchain technology and its potential applications in healthcare.





1.2 Purpose & motivation behind the project

Our modern digital world is increasingly shifting toward electronic healthcare records, raising significant concerns about data security and privacy. Traditional centralized systems are highly vulnerable to cyberattacks, data breaches, and unauthorized access, leading to serious consequences such as identity theft, medical fraud, and a decline in patient trust. Recognizing these challenges, our project, "Protecting Personal Healthcare Records Using Blockchain Technology," is designed to provide a decentralized, secure, and tamper-proof solution for managing healthcare data.
The primary objective of this project is to enhance the security, privacy, and integrity of personal healthcare records by leveraging blockchain technology. Blockchain functions as a decentralized ledger, ensuring that data remains immutable, transparent, and accessible only to authorized individuals. By incorporating smart contracts, we can automate access control, allowing only patients and approved healthcare professionals to view or modify medical records. This eliminates reliance on centralized databases, which are prone to single points of failure and external threats.
What drives this project is the alarming rise in cyberattacks targeting healthcare systems and the urgent need for a trustworthy, transparent, and secure method to store sensitive patient information. Traditional systems depend on centralized storage, making them easy targets for hackers. Blockchain, however, provides data redundancy, cryptographic security, and decentralization, making it a robust solution for safeguarding healthcare data. Each block in the chain is encrypted and linked to the previous block, ensuring that no one can alter or delete records without proper authorization.
Beyond security, blockchain technology also enhances interoperability among healthcare providers by enabling seamless, secure data sharing without compromising patient privacy. The current healthcare system suffers from fragmented data storage, where patient records are scattered across different hospitals, clinics, and databases. This often leads to delayed treatment, redundant tests, and administrative inefficiencies. By implementing blockchain, healthcare providers can securely access patient records in real time, improving diagnosis accuracy, treatment efficiency, and overall patient care.
•	Data Security: Blockchain ensures encrypted, immutable records that cannot be altered or deleted.
•	Privacy Protection: Only authorized individuals can access sensitive healthcare information.
•	Patient Control: Empowers individuals to manage and control access to their medical records.
By implementing this blockchain-based solution, we aim to revolutionize healthcare data management, reduce security risks, and establish a more efficient, transparent, and secure future for personal healthcare records.

1.3 Problem statement
In today’s rapidly evolving healthcare landscape, personal healthcare records (PHRs) are predominantly stored and managed through centralized systems. While these systems have facilitated the transition from paper-based records to digital storage, they come with significant vulnerabilities that threaten patient privacy, data integrity, and overall security. Traditional centralized databases act as a single point of failure, making them highly susceptible to cyberattacks, data breaches, and unauthorized access. In an era where personal information is increasingly targeted by malicious actors, protecting sensitive medical records has become a pressing concern for both patients and healthcare providers.
One of the most critical challenges in the current healthcare data management system is the lack of interoperability between different institutions and service providers. Hospitals, clinics, and laboratories often use proprietary systems that do not effectively communicate with one another. As a result, sharing medical records between different entities becomes complicated, leading to inefficiencies in diagnosis, treatment planning, and medical history tracking. This fragmented approach causes delays in patient care, forcing individuals to undergo repetitive tests or procedures simply because their previous records are inaccessible or unverified by another healthcare provider.
Another major issue lies in patient autonomy and control over personal health data. Under current models, patients have limited access to their own medical history, as their records are typically owned and maintained by hospitals, insurance companies, or third-party providers. This dependency makes it difficult for patients to securely track, retrieve, or share their medical information when needed.
This project aims to address these fundamental issues by leveraging blockchain technology to build a secure, immutable, and decentralized healthcare record management system. Blockchain introduces a tamper-proof ledger where each medical record is encrypted, time-stamped, and linked to the previous records, making it nearly impossible for unauthorized modifications to occur. By integrating smart contracts and cryptographic authentication mechanisms, this system ensures that only authorized individuals—such as patients and verified healthcare professionals—can access, update, or share medical data.
With decentralization, the risks associated with single points of failure, data breaches, and unauthorized modifications are significantly reduced. Patients regain full control over their health records, allowing them to manage, track, and securely share their information as needed. Healthcare providers benefit from enhanced interoperability, as blockchain enables seamless data sharing without compromising security or patient confidentiality. This transformation not only strengthens privacy and security but also improves efficiency, accuracy, and transparency in healthcare record management.
By implementing this blockchain-based solution, we aim to revolutionize the way personal healthcare records are stored and managed, ensuring a safer, more reliable, and patient-centric approach to digital healthcare.

With MySQL’s advanced query optimization and indexing, retrieving patient records, managing doctor files, and tracking blockchain transactions becomes seamless. Furthermore, role-based access control (RBAC) is enforced to restrict unauthorized access, ensuring that only doctors, patients, and hospitals with the necessary permissions can view or modify records. By integrating MySQL with blockchain technology, data immutability and transparency are maintained, providing a tamper-proof system for securing healthcare information.

Blockchain Technologies
The Protecting Personal Healthcare Records Using Blockchain system leverages blockchain technology to ensure security, transparency, and immutability of sensitive healthcare data. By integrating a decentralized ledger, the system prevents unauthorized modifications, ensuring that patient records remain tamper-proof and verifiable. Every transaction, including record access, updates, and modifications, is securely logged on the blockchain, enhancing data integrity and reducing fraud risks.
Blockchain enhances data security by providing cryptographic encryption, distributed consensus, and access control mechanisms. Unlike traditional centralized databases, blockchain eliminates the risk of single points of failure, making it an ideal choice for safeguarding personal healthcare records. With smart contracts, the system automates essential processes like record validation, access permissions, and transaction approvals, reducing the need for manual intervention while ensuring compliance with predefined rules.
Blockchain Framework (Hyperledger Fabric / Ethereum)
A blockchain framework serves as the backbone of the system, enabling secure and immutable storage of healthcare records. Two widely used frameworks—Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum—offer different benefits based on the system’s requirements:
•	Hyperledger Fabric: Designed for permissioned blockchain networks, Hyperledger Fabric is ideal for healthcare applications where access control and regulatory compliance are crucial. It allows authorized entities, such as doctors, hospitals, and patients, to interact securely while maintaining a private, efficient, and scalable blockchain environment.
•	Ethereum: A public and decentralized blockchain, Ethereum is suitable for scenarios where transparency is the priority. It allows patients to have complete control over their medical records, ensuring trustless verification and open accessibility while maintaining security through cryptographic hashing.
By using Hyperledger Fabric for restricted networks and Ethereum for decentralized healthcare solutions, the system ensures both privacy and accessibility, catering to different levels of user control and data-sharing requirements.

Explanation:

This JSP script processes a patient data access request by updating its status in the database. It retrieves the request id from the user input, sets the status to "Permitted" in the pat_req table, and executes the update query using JDBC. After updating, it closes the database connection and redirects the user to "c_pat_acc_req.jsp", which likely displays the updated request list. If an error occurs, it catches and prints the exception message.

Explanation:

This JSP script retrieves patient data from a database, encrypts it using AES encryption, and decodes certain fields using Base64. It first fetches the pid from the request, queries the cloudlet_files table for patient details, and extracts multiple data fields. A predefined AES key (q2e34rrfgfgfgg2a) is used for encryption, ensuring secure data storage and transmission. Some fields are Base64 decoded for further processing. The script enhances data confidentiality by securing sensitive patient information.

Database Connectivity:

Connection connection = null;
  try {    
	  Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");	
	  connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/pphr","root","root");
      String sql="";
}
catch(Exception e)
{
System.out.println(e);
}
%>
Explanation:

This JSP code attempts to establish a connection to a MySQL database named "pphr" using JDBC. It first imports the required Java SQL classes and utilities. Inside a try block, it loads the MySQL JDBC driver (com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver) and establishes a connection using DriverManager.getConnection with localhost, port 3306, and credentials (root, root). A placeholder SQL query (String sql="") is defined but not executed. If an exception occurs, it is caught in the catch block, though the error message is commented out. This setup is typically used for database-driven web applications but lacks proper resource management and error handling.

Explanation:

This JSP authentication script verifies user login for a patient authentication system. It retrieves the username and password from the request, then queries the MySQL database to check credentials. If valid, it checks if the user is authorized. If authorized, a 6-digit OTP is generated, stored in the database, and displayed via JavaScript alert. The user is then redirected to p_verify.jsp for OTP verification. If unauthorized, an error message is shown. If login fails, an invalid login message appears. The script lacks prepared statements, making it vulnerable to SQL injection and needs better error handling and security measures.

Explanation:


This JSP (JavaServer Pages) script retrieves and decrypts patient medical records stored in a cloud database using AES encryption. It begins by importing various Java libraries, including database connection (connect.jsp), cryptographic utilities (javax.crypto), and encoding utilities (org.bouncycastle.util.encoders.Base64). The script queries a database (cloudlet_files) to fetch distinct digital signatures (dsig), which are used to verify the authenticity of the records.
For each retrieved record, it decrypts multiple fields such as the patient's name, contact number, email, address, and medical details (ECG, pulses, symptoms) using a predefined AES key (q2e34rrfgfgfgg2a). The decryption process is achieved using Cipher in AES mode, and the Base64-encoded data is converted back to plaintext.
The script dynamically generates an HTML table displaying the decrypted patient details, including a profile image (d_p_Pic.jsp?id=<%=i%>), a digitally signed hash code (dsig), and the corresponding disease name. It also presents the content of an encrypted medical file within a textarea, ensuring the integrity of the retrieved data.




5.4 Challenges Faced During Development
1.	Blockchain Integration
o	Implementing blockchain for securing personal healthcare records required complex smart contract development and consensus mechanisms to ensure data integrity.
o	Managing efficient storage of medical records on-chain while maintaining performance and scalability was a challenge.
2.	Encryption Format
o	Implementing AES encryption for securing patient data required proper key management to prevent unauthorized access.
o	Base64 encoding/decoding was challenging in ensuring data was correctly encrypted and decrypted without corruption.
o	Performance issues arose when handling large datasets, requiring optimization in encryption processes.
3.	JSChart Implementation
o	Integrating dynamic charts for data visualization required configuring real-time updates for blockchain-stored healthcare records.
o	Ensuring cross-browser compatibility and responsiveness of charts was another challenge.
o	Handling large datasets efficiently while rendering charts without affecting UI performance required asynchronous data fetching.
4.  Database Optimization
o	Ensuring fast query execution for patient record retrieval.
o	Managing large datasets in a secure and scalable manner.
o	Handling Concurrent Access and Transactions.
5.  User Authentication & Access Control
o	Implementing role-based access control for secure patient data access.
o	Ensuring secure login mechanisms with multi-factor authentication (MFA).

Each of these challenges was addressed through optimization, testing, and integrating secure frameworks to ensure a reliable and efficient system.















CHAPTER-6:
TESTING










6.TESTING
6.1 Types of Testing Conducted 
The purpose of testing is to discover errors. Testing is the process of trying to discover every conceivable fault or weakness in a work product. It provides a way to check the functionality of components, sub assemblies, assemblies and/or a finished product There are various types of test. Each test type addresses a specific testing requirement.
Types of Tests
6.1.1. Unit Testing
Unit testing focuses on verifying individual software components to ensure they function correctly. It checks program logic, input-output validation, and decision branches. This structural testing is conducted before integration, ensuring:
•	Proper internal logic functionality
•	Defined inputs generate expected outputs
•	Business processes operate accurately
6.1.2. Integration Testing
Integration testing verifies that individual software components function correctly as a combined system. This process identifies defects arising from module interactions, ensuring:
•	Components run as a unified program
•	Interfaces between modules function correctly
•	Expected outcomes from component interactions
6.1.3. System Testing
System testing validates the entire integrated software system. It ensures that the configuration behaves predictably and aligns with process descriptions and integration points.
6.1.4. White Box Testing
White Box Testing is a testing in which in which the software tester has knowledge of the inner workings, structure and language of the software, or at least its purpose. It is purpose. It is used to test areas that cannot be reached from a black box level.
6.1.5. Black Box Testing
Black Box Testing is testing the software without any knowledge of the inner workings, structure or language of the module being tested. Black box tests, as most other kinds of tests, must be written from a definitive source document, such as specification or requirements document, such as specification or requirements document. It is a testing in which the software under test is treated, as a black box .you cannot “see” into it. The test provides inputs and responds to outputs without considering how the software works.

By leveraging Hyperledger Fabric or Ethereum, the system provides tamper-proof, transparent, and immutable storage, eliminating unauthorized modifications and ensuring that only authorized entities can access or update sensitive medical information.
With a Java-based backend, MySQL for secure data storage, and AES encryption for data confidentiality, the system enhances privacy protection and prevents unauthorized breaches. SHA-1 digital signatures further reinforce authentication and non-repudiation, ensuring that all transactions are securely recorded and verifiable. The integration of smart contracts automates access control and verification, reducing reliance on manual processes while improving efficiency and security.
The use of modern development tools like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, and Git-based version control ensures a scalable, maintainable, and robust software architecture. Overall, the project provides a highly secure, efficient, and future-ready solution for managing healthcare records, addressing key concerns in data security, privacy, and interoperability within the healthcare sector. By combining cutting-edge technologies, this system sets a foundation for trustworthy and seamless healthcare record management, paving the way for enhanced patient care and data-driven decision-making.

8.2 Challenges faced & how they were addressed
During the development of our blockchain-based healthcare record system, we encountered several challenges that required innovative solutions. One major challenge was integrating blockchain technology to ensure secure and immutable patient records. Implementing smart contracts and managing transactions efficiently was complex, but we addressed this by using Hyperledger Fabric, which provided a private blockchain network with scalable and efficient transaction validation.
Another significant challenge was encrypting and decrypting patient data while maintaining system performance. Since sensitive medical records needed strong security, we implemented AES encryption to safeguard data. Optimizing decryption algorithms ensured that authorized users could quickly access medical information without significant delays. Additionally, visualizing patient health trends through JSChart posed difficulties in rendering dynamic data efficiently. To overcome this, we optimized database queries and used caching techniques to enhance performance.
Security vulnerabilities in smart contracts, such as re-entrancy attacks and overflow errors, also presented risks. We mitigated these by following Solidity best practices, including input validation and automated security audits with tools like MythX, ensuring robust protection against potential exploits. Lastly, system scalability was a concern, as managing large datasets and high user loads required efficient database handling. We tackled this issue by implementing MySQL indexing, load balancing, and caching strategies, significantly improving query execution speed and overall system performance.
By addressing these challenges effectively, our system ensures security, efficiency, and reliability, providing a seamless and secure platform for managing personal healthcare records using blockchain technology.
